# :material-download-box: Installing Mods

Installing Mods is pretty Straight forward... Just Download a Zip and Extract it into your Bot Folder.

## Downloading

:   You need to Download the blocks from the `currently` official DBB Block Storage Website.  
[Download All Blocks :fontawesome-solid-download:](https://blocks.dbb.software/Blocks/!allBlocks.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[Storage Server :fontawesome-solid-link:](https://blocks.dbb.software/Blocks/){ .md-button target="_blank"}

:  !!! danger "IMPORTANT"
    **DO NOT DELETE THE OLD BLOCKS**  
    Watch out not to Click the `Update Blocks Folder` in the `Project` Tab, cause that will reset your Blocks to OoTB(Out-of-The-Box) State.
