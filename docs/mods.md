# Installing Mods

Installing Mods is pretty Straight forward... Just Download a Zip and Extract it into your Bot Folder.

## Downloading

You need to Download the blocks from the `currently` official DBB Block Storage Website.  

[Download All Blocks :fontawesome-solid-download:](https://blocks.dbb.software/Blocks/!allBlocks.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[Storage Server :fontawesome-solid-link:](https://blocks.dbb.software/Blocks/){ .md-button :target="_blank"}

## Extracting
Just Drag the blocks inside the `!allBlocks.zip` file into the Blocks Folder of your Project. Make sure to replace the old files/blocks!

!!! danger "IMPORTANT"
    **REPLACING BLOCKS IS NEEDED, WHEN PROMPTED (MANUALLY DELETING IS BAD)**  

    Watch out not to Click the `Update Blocks Folder` in the `Project` Tab, cause that will reset your Blocks to OoTB(Out-of-The-Box) State.
