# Adding Workspaces
This Part will Explain how to install/add Workspaces from our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PAzxTDw){:target="_blank"}.

In the Workspaces Channel on the DBB Discord, there you can find a txt file with the JSON Code for the Workspace.
Just Copy the Content of that File and Paste it into a new Created Workspace.
(Note: You may need Custom Modded Blocks that should be mentioned in the Thread)
